CS354 - Programming Languages - Fall 2019

This program is a pure-ruby implementation of a Sudoku game, complete with a working GUI. The intent of this project was to give us a programming language none of us had ever worked with before, and create something reasonably large and complex to showcase the languages features. Our team of 4 bit off a bit more than we could chew with this, but we learned quite a lot!

The program has it's own algorithm that creates a solvable Sudoku board, as well as an algorithm for giving the player feedback about what moves they've done incorrectly. The GUI is made with the Ruby2D library.
