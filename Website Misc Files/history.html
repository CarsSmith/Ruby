        <h1>History and Description of Ruby</h1>
        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p>Ruby was released in 1995 by computer scientist Yukihiro Matsumoto as an attempt to combine the strengths of Perl and Python. Matsumoto's goal was to create a truly object-oriented language with simple syntax, that was also very portable. In his own words, Matsumoto said, "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python." He could not find any language that met his requirements for an ideal language, and thus Ruby was created. The name "Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby" â€“ it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues. Since its initial release Ruby has grown in popularity, and has remained in the top 20 most popular programming languages since 2006. Some applications built by a form of ruby are Airbnb, Github, Kickstarter, Fiverr, Bleacher Report, Twitch, and Hulu.</p>
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Ruby is a dynamically typed scripting language designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, that can run on Windows, Mac OS and Unix (Tutorialspoint). Matsumoto created the language with a blend of some of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp), making Ruby a perfect object-oriented language (About Ruby). What makes this a perfect object-oriented language is that predefined types are objects, user types are objects, and operation defined on objects must be through methods exposed by objects (GeeksforGeeks). Essentially everything in Ruby is an object and must be used as such. Matsumoto goal with this language was to have better syntax then say Smalltalk and be more object-oriented than Python (About Ruby). Ruby is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.It's also a great choice for many startups because of Ruby on Rails framework, a full-stack web framework that makes prototyping a breeze.</p>
